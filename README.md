# BusDepartureScreen
This repo is for the development of a display that can display rea-time arrival time of a bus, train, etc

In this environment I am using an ESP-32-C3 Dev Board, I have purchased a screen off amazon but I will likely be replacing it soon.

For my IDE I am using VS Code with the official IDF-ESP pluigin. I may switch to Arduino IDE later but I would prefer to write my own
libraries for learning purposes rather than using existing ones.
